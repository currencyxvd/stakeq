# Staking and Nodes Example

This repository contains an example of how to implement staking using smart contracts and setting up nodes in a blockchain network.

## Features
- Staking smart contract in Solidity.
- Instructions to set up a node.
- Example tests for staking logic.
- CI/CD pipeline for testing smart contracts.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- Truffle or Hardhat (for contract compilation and testing)
- Ganache (for local Ethereum blockchain)
- Solidity (v0.8+)
- Docker (for running blockchain nodes)
